    <h1>Metaphor</h1>
    </div>
    
    <p>A Metaphor is a mapping from one domain to another. for example, moo is a cow as beep is to car. These mappings get so buried in our language that we don't even notice their effects.</p>

    <p>For example, take the language used to describe a debate:</p>

    <div class="word">
        <p><b>
            "He shot down her ideas"<br><br>
            "She Defended her position"<br><br>
            "She overwhelmed his argument"<br><br>
            "He had to retreat from that position"
            </b>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>These are all debate-as-war metaphor. It's a zero sum game. Someone wins and someone loses. The idea that both people could learn from each other just doesn't come up</p>
