<p>Smartphone cameras get better every year, but this year more than ever truly felt like a leap. For once, we can talk about more than just Apple and Samsung (and Google) when referring to the “top tier” of smartphones with good cameras. And what’s fascinating is that, after the race to cram megapixels and ultra-wide apertures into these phones made them all kind of the same for a year or two, now there are loads of differences. Multiple companies have armed their phones with dual cameras; Google released a followup to the excellent, software-driven Pixel; and names like HTC are back in the mix after years of building subpar shooters.<br>
<br>

So, of course, we wanted to see how the best stack up. For our comparison we picked the iPhone X, the Google Pixel 2 XL, the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, the HTC U11, and the LG V30. These are the best of the best, the phones that have the most cutting edge cameras you can buy. Keep in mind everything said about the Pixel 2 XL will also apply to the Pixel 2, as they have the same camera. And the Note 8 has the same main wide camera as the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus, meaning you can translate those findings to those phones, too. The iPhone X, however, has a slightly wider aperture on the telephoto camera than on the 8 Plus, so bear that in mind.</p><br>

<p>Our methodology was pretty simple. I had all five phones with me and tried to recreate the same framing of each shot with each phone. I let the phones do their work — no tapping to focus or expose, everything on full auto using the stock camera apps. This comparison is more of an attempt to gauge how these phones are reading and adjusting for a scene than a scientific analysis of what their sensors and hardware capture. (There are plenty of great technical tests worth pixel-peeping, like at GSMArena.)<br>
<br>


I’m also more interested in the choices these phones (and the engineers who designed the software) make with regards to how they take that information from what is largely similar hardware and turn it into a final JPEG image you can view, print, or share. The information captured by the sensor is whittled and shaped to something more manageable in size, but in that whittling and shaping is a ton of room for what amounts to editorial choices by the designers of the camera systems. By the end of this piece, we’ll hopefully have a better understanding of what those choices are.</p>
